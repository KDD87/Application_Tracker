# Application_Tracker
This is a personal project to help track of job application I have submitted, and the current status of them. So far it consists of three main components the.

* HomeBar
* AddApp
* IndividualJobCard

The Home component is made up of a navigation bar at the top of the page and then a vertically scrolling list of jobs the user has applied to. Clicking on the name in the top left of the navigation bar will always navigate a user back to the home page. Clicking on the add application button in the top right corner of the topbar will navigate a user to the AddApp component. Clicking on an individual job card will navigate a user to the IndividualJobCard, and if a user wishes to search for a specific job in the list they can use the search bar in the middle of the navigation bar to do so.

The AddApp component consists of the navigation bar at the top but without the search functionallity and a form that allows the user to input the company name, job description and anything notes they wish to add about the job or company.

The IndividualJobCard component consists of the nav bar without the search feature and a job card. The card currently includes the company name, the job description, and any notes about the company or postion. It also includes a link to the company website and the date the user applied to the job. It also allows the user to edit the description or the notes and save the changes.

This project is still in the implementation phase and will hopefully have new features soon!
