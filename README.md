This is a personal project to help track of job application I have submitted, and the current status of them. So far it consists of three main components the.

* Home
* Add App

The Home component is made up of a navigation bar at the top of the page and then a vertically scrolling list of jobs I have applied to. Clicking on the name in the top left of the topbar will always navigate a user back to the home page. Clicking on the add app button in the top right corner of the topbar will navigate a user to the AddApp component. clicking on an individual job cad will navigate a user to the IndividualJobCard.
